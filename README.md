# Bluetooth Low Energy in iOS Swift

## Chapter 13: Project: Remote Control LED


These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy with iOS Swift_.  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices using iOS/Swift.  

This chapter teaches:
* Central: Create a remote control for a Bluetooth Low Energy LED that can turn the LED on and off remotely.
* Peripheral: Create a remotely controlled LED using the camera torch that can be switched on and off with command from a connected Remote Control
